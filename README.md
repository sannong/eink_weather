# E-ink Weather and Calendar Display

This is a simple ESPHome based e-ink weather and calendar display project. I used a 7.5" waveshare e-paper display and the waveshare ESP32 universal driver module. I mounted the whole thing in a picture frame and run it off USB power (no battery).

## Hardware

The following hardware was used:

- [Waveshare 800Ã—480, 7.5inch E-Ink display HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.5inch-e-paper-hat.htm?___SID=U)
- [Waveshare Universal e-Paper Raw Panel Driver Board, ESP32 WiFi / Bluetooth Wireless](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/driver-boards/e-paper-esp32-driver-board.htm)
- [Custom Frame and Mat](https://www.frameiteasy.com/)
  - I custom ordered a frame with the following dimmensions to fit the screen:
    - Matboard: Inner Dimension 6 1/2" x 3 15/16", Outer Dimension 8 1/2" x 5 15/16"
    - Frame: Art Size: 8 1/2" x 5 15/16"

### Hardware Setup

There isn't really any hardware setup. Just connect the screen to the universal display module and plug in USB power (USB-C). To test the display before moving onto ESPHome I downloaded the Arduino example code from Waveshare and ran it just to make sure the display worked: [E-Paper ESP32 Driver Board](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_ESP32_Driver_Board)

- For the 7.5" display I used I had the A/B resistor switch on the driver board set to "B" per the documentation. 

## Home Assistant Setup

### Integrations

This project uses the following integrations:

- [Sun](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sun)
- [Moon](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/moon)
- [The Weather Channel (HACS)](https://github.com/jaydeethree/Home-Assistant-weatherdotcom)
  - You can substitute in whatever weather service you like
- [NWS Alerts (HACS)](https://github.com/finity69x2/nws_alerts)
- [Google Calendar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google)
- [ESPHome](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/esphome)

### Python Script

A python script is used to format the calendar event data. Copy the python_scripts folder and contents provided to your Home Assistant root directory (creating the python_scripts folder at the root level if needed)

### Template Sensors and Configuration

The display makes use of multiple templated sensors and configuration in HA_epaper.yaml. These must be integrated into the Home Assistant configuration.yaml (or custom yaml file).

1. First edit the HA_epaper.yaml file provided under HomeAssistant_sensor folder to customize for your setup
    - The weather service provider should be set to your desired provider. Change all occurrences of "weather.weather_ch" to your weather provider. The project assumes the weather provider provides daily weather forecast data via the weather-get_forecasts call.
2. Edit the calendar entity IDs to your own. These are stored in the secrets.yaml file.

    ```yaml
    entity_id:
                # Add your calendar entity id's here
                - !secret calendar1
                - !secret calendar2
                - !secret calendar3
    ```

3. Integrate/copy the HA_epaper.yaml file into your configuration.yaml file. If a template: section already exists in your file just append the template section from the HA_epaper.yaml.
4. After integrating restart HA
5. You can verify proper operation by checking the "ESP Calendar Data" and "e-paper display data" sensor entities and see that they are populated with data.

## ESPHome Setup

Following the ESPHome guides I installed ESPHome on the driver board using the Windows command line/python version of ESPHome. I did not use the Home Assistant ESPHome device builder but you could.

The project uses a secrets.yaml file which needs to be populated with the following secure credentials provided by your setup and the ESPHome initial base installation on the device Create a secrets.yaml file in the root folder of the project and populate it with the following (filling in the values for your setup):

```
wifi_ssid: 
wifi_password:
ota_password: 
encryption_key: 
fallback_password: 
```

Once installed compile and flash the provided epaper.yaml file to the board.
